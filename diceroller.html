	<h3>v0.12</h3>
	
	<p>Dice Roller is a simple dice rolling app for use in role-playing games over Google+ Hangout! It includes 
	a history function that timestamps all dice rolls with the user that rolled and the results.</p>
	
	<p>Dice Roller, does what it says on the tin! Click the Hangouts button below to start a new Hangout session
	 and launch the app.</p>
	 
	 <h3>May 23, 2012 Update</h3>
	 <p>After extensive use and testing, Firefox seems to work best with this app and Google+ Hangout. This seems to stem
	 from the issue that Firefox does not care that the HTTPS session is pulling data from a HTTP source. Therefore, it doesn't force a log out and
	 log back in (which seems to then freeze other users in the session and eventually kicks them out).</p>
	 
	 <p>I've got a query into Google as to why this behavior is happening</p>
	 
	 <hr />
	 
	 <p>Note: If you are using the Chrome browser, you will receive an <i>insecure content</i> pop-up warning, which usually manifests itself by 
	 the browser address bar depending on which browser you are using. The app will not load unless you give it permission.</p>
	 
	 <p>This warning appears becuase you are connected via https to Google while it is trying to access the 
	 app's resources on my host, which is only making a http connection. Unfortunately this will not be resolved
	 until I get an ssl cert for my site (too expensive) or I transfer the whole app to the Google App Engine (on the checklist to do in the future)</p>
